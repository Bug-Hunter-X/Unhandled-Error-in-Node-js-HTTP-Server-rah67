This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js HTTP servers: the lack of error handling in the `server.listen()` method.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which can lead to unexpected crashes if the specified port is already in use or other errors arise during server initialization.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
